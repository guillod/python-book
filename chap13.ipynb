    "Charles Babbage was the first to break the Vigenère cipher. The idea is that three consecutive letters appearing several times in the cipher text are likely to be the result of encrypting the same letters of the message with the same letters of the key. This is even more likely with a group of four letters. Thus, the spacing between two same groups of cipher letters is a multiple of the key length. For example, if the repetition of one group is spaced 28 letters apart, then the repetition of another is spaced 91 letters apart, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 91 is 7. So, it is likely that the key has 7 letters. Then knowing the size of the key, it is enough to base on the fact that the letter \"E\" is the most common in English. For this strategy to have a chance of success, the size of the text must be large enough.\n",
